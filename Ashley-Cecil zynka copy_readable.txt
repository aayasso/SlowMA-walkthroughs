----------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: THE PIERCING GAZE
======================================================================

⏱️  LOOK AWAY: 60 seconds
   While looking at the artwork:
   "What does it feel like to be watched by this solitary eye?"

👁️  OBSERVATION
   Notice how this single eye seems to look directly at you through a triangular window. The realistic painting contrasts dramatically with the rich purple fabric surrounding it.

💡 WHY THIS MATTERS
   This creates an intimate, almost unsettling connection - like being seen through a veil or mask.

STEP 2: COLOR AS EMOTION
======================================================================

⏱️  LOOK AWAY: 45 seconds
   While looking at the artwork:
   "How does this color make the space around the eye feel?"

👁️  OBSERVATION
   See how this deep, rich purple dominates the upper portion - it's the color of mystery, royalty, and the mystical. Against it, the warm skin tones seem to glow.

💡 WHY THIS MATTERS
   Purple has been associated with the spiritual realm across cultures - this isn't just decoration, it's atmosphere.

🔗 BUILDS ON
   The purple frame transforms our reading of the eye from portrait to portal

STEP 3: LAYERS OF STORY
======================================================================

⏱️  LOOK AWAY: 50 seconds
   While looking at the artwork:
   "What stories might these different fabrics have lived before coming together here?"

👁️  OBSERVATION
   Notice how different fabrics and patterns layer together - metallic gold, burgundy trim, and delicate florals. Each material has its own history and texture.

💡 WHY THIS MATTERS
   Like a patchwork of memories, these fabrics suggest stories within stories, past lives of these materials.

🔗 BUILDS ON
   The layered fabrics create earthly richness that contrasts with the spiritual purple above

STEP 4: FINISHING TOUCHES
======================================================================

⏱️  LOOK AWAY: 35 seconds
   While looking at the artwork:
   "How do these tassels change the feeling from formal artwork to intimate object?"

👁️  OBSERVATION
   See those cream-colored tassels dancing along the bottom edge? They add movement and softness, like a gentle fringe that invites touch.

💡 WHY THIS MATTERS
   These tactile details remind us this isn't just an image to look at - it's a textile meant to be experienced.

🔗 BUILDS ON
   The tassels provide a gentle, welcoming counterpoint to the intensity of the watching eye
