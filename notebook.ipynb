        "   - Rich, complex works: 5-6 stops\n",
        "   - Quality over quantity - each stop must genuinely teach something\n",
        "\n",
        "2. PEDAGOGICAL SEQUENCING\n",
        "   - Order matters! Start with accessible observations, build to deeper insights\n",
        "   - Each stop should naturally lead to the next\n",
        "   - Create a narrative arc through the artwork\n",
        "   - Consider: immediate → compositional → technical → symbolic → contextual\n",

        "3. LOOK-AWAY TIMING (30-60 seconds per stop)\n",
        "   - Longer for complex observations requiring careful looking\n",

        "   - First stop often longer (60s) to settle into the experience\n",

        "   - Ask gentle questions\n",
        "   - Connect to universal human experience\n",
